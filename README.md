# Hi there! 👋

I'm Slaven, a System Administrator with experience in Windows Server, PowerShell, M365, and Linux. I'm looking to transition into a Linux Admin, Cloud Engineer, or DevOps Engineer role. I'm currently enjoying setting up my homelab with my old gaming PC, my old laptop, and a cheap Raspberry Pi. I'm also on my way to set up good procedures, pipelines, and infrastructure for a couple of applications in a startup where I currently work.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack:

- 🐳 Docker | Docker Compose
- ☁️ AWS (S3, RDS, IAM) | Hetzner Cloud | M365
- 🔧 PowerShell | Bash | Terraform | Ansible | CI/CD (Azure Pipelines)
- 🖥️ Linux | WSL | Windows | Windows Server
